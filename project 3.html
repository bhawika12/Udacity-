<section> All penguins have a white belly and a black back. Penguins cannot fly, but they can swim very well. They have good hearing. The white and black colors are for camouflage when they swim. So, when a predator looking from underwater sees the white belly and wings of the penguin, they can not see it well with the light coming from above. </section>
